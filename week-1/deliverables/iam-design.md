# IAM Design — Secure GCP Foundation

## 1. Overview

This document defines the **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** design for a secure and scalable GCP foundation.  
It serves as the Week-1 deliverable under the **Security Architecture Mastery Path**, emphasizing:
- Least privilege principle
- Separation of duties
- Keyless authentication
- Centralized governance with distributed access

The design balances **security rigor** and **operational practicality**, following enterprise-grade GCP patterns.

## 2. Resource Hierarchy

Organization: my-org
│
├── Folder: Production
│ ├── Project: reaper-prod
│ ├── Project: chronos-prod
│ └── Project: prod-infra
│

├── Folder: Staging
│ ├── Project: reaper-stage
│ ├── Project: chronos-stage
│ └── Project: stage-infra
│

└── Folder: Shared-Services
├── Project: networking
├── Project: monitoring
└── Project: automation



### Design Rationale
- **Environment-based folders** ensure strong policy and access segregation between prod, staging, and shared services.
- **Projects** group related workloads and budgets.
- **Folders** allow environment-wide IAM enforcement (e.g., "no dev access in prod").
- Policies inherit top-down but can be overridden at the project level for precision.

**Access governance:**  
Broad IAM (e.g., auditors, infra admins) applies at folder level;  
App-specific IAM applies at project level.  
This model reduces management overhead while maintaining isolation.

## 3. Role Design Strategy

IAM roles define *who can do what* at each layer.  
Two types exist — **predefined** and **custom** — each serving different control levels.

### Core Philosophy
> Use **predefined roles** by default at the **project level** for common operations.  
> Use **custom roles** sparingly — only when predefined roles are over-privileged or at organization scope.

### Comparative View

| Role Type | Use Case | Scope | Benefit | Risk |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| **Predefined** | Common GCP operations (Compute, Storage, Cloud Run, Monitoring) | Project | Easy to use, auto-maintained | Overlap & tracking overhead |
| **Custom** | Precise least-privilege enforcement (Terraform, Org Security, Audit) | Org / Folder / Project | Fine-grained control | Operational complexity |

### Role Governance Rules
1. **Default to predefined** roles at project scope.  
2. **Custom roles require approval & versioning.**  
3. **All IAM managed via Terraform or GitOps** — no manual role grants.  
4. **Groups over users:** Assign to Workspace groups, not individuals.  
5. **Review quarterly:** Remove unused roles with IAM Recommender insights.

### Example Roles

| Persona | Role Type | Scope | Purpose |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| Terraform SA | Custom | Project | Provisioning limited resources (no org-level access) |
| Developers | Predefined | Project | Use Compute, Cloud Run, and Storage with limited scopes |
| Security Admins | Custom | Org | Manage SCC, IAM policy, and org constraints |
| Network Team | Predefined | Host Project | `roles/compute.networkAdmin` |
| Auditors | Predefined | Org/Folder | Read-only access to logs and SCC findings |

### Example Custom Role Snippet — Terraform Provisioner

{
  "title": "Terraform Provisioner v1",
  "description": "Minimal permissions for Terraform automation",
  "includedPermissions": [
    "compute.instances.create",
    "compute.instances.delete",
    "compute.networks.get",
    "compute.subnetworks.get",
    "compute.firewalls.create",
    "storage.buckets.create",
    "iam.serviceAccounts.actAs"
  ]
}


| Service Account                                         | Purpose                | Scope           | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `tf-admin@infra-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`        | Terraform provisioning | Project         | Used via impersonation or WIF; no static key  |
| `app-sa@apps-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`           | Application runtime    | Project         | Limited to secrets, logging, and GCS          |
| `monitor-sa@monitoring-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | Monitoring & logging   | Shared Services | MetricWriter + LogWriter                      |
| `automation-sa@shared-services.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | CI/CD automation       | Shared Services | Used by Cloud Build or GitHub Actions via WIF |


Security Controls

No static keys. JSON keys are prohibited unless justified and tracked.

Impersonation and federation only.

Internal runners (Cloud Build, GCE) use Service Account Impersonation (roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator).

External CI/CD (GitHub, Jenkins) use Workload Identity Federation (WIF) for keyless auth.

Dedicated service accounts per function — no reuse across environments.

Example WIF Policy

Terraform in GitHub Actions:

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
steps:
  - name: "Authenticate to GCP"
    uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
    with:
      workload_identity_provider: "projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github"
      service_account: "tf-admin@infra-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"


Result → short-lived token; no permanent key exposure.

| Group / Identity     | Scope                 | Typical Roles                                                        | Description                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Org Admins**       | Org                   | `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`, `roles/iam.securityAdmin` | Full governance control           |
| **Security Team**    | Org / Folder          | `roles/securitycenter.admin`, custom security roles                  | Posture management & compliance   |
| **Infra Admins**     | Folder (Prod/Staging) | `roles/editor`, network admin                                        | Build and maintain resources      |
| **Developers**       | Project               | Custom or predefined deploy roles                                    | Limited access to own projects    |
| **Auditors**         | Org                   | `roles/viewer`, `roles/logging.viewer`                               | Read-only monitoring & compliance |
| **Service Accounts** | Project               | Custom least-privilege                                               | Machine access for automation     |


Principles enforced:

Role separation: No single user can provision and approve.

Group-based IAM: Users join IAM groups, not direct bindings.

Folder-level policy boundaries: Prod isolation enforced via IAM conditions.

6. Authentication & Key Management
6.1 Allowed Authentication Methods

Workload Identity Federation (WIF) for external automation.

Service Account Impersonation for internal tools (Cloud Build, GCE).

OAuth 2.0 User Authentication for administrators via SSO.

6.2 Forbidden Practices

Static JSON keys for Terraform or automation.

Shared service accounts between users or pipelines.

Long-lived credentials without rotation.

6.3 Monitoring

Cloud Logging Filter for key creation:

protoPayload.serviceName="iam.googleapis.com"
protoPayload.methodName="google.iam.admin.v1.CreateServiceAccountKey"

→ Alerts security team on new key creation.

| Control                | Frequency  | Owner         | Description                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| IAM Audit Review       | Quarterly  | Security Team | Review role bindings and unused permissions |
| Key Scan               | Continuous | Security Bot  | Detect static key creation via logs         |
| Role Registry          | Ongoing    | Platform Team | Maintain versioned custom roles in Git      |
| Policy Simulator Tests | On-demand  | DevOps        | Validate IAM changes pre-deployment         |


Versioning convention:
custom.RoleName_v1, increment on permission change.

8. Security Architecture Philosophy

"Access is not granted; it is earned, reviewed, and expired."

This IAM framework follows a Zero Trust mindset:

Every permission must be provable and auditable.

No long-lived secrets, no broad editor roles.

Every actor (human or machine) has an identity, a purpose, and a boundary.

The architecture combines:

Environment-level segregation (folder hierarchy),

Least privilege access (custom/predefined mix),

Keyless operations (impersonation/WIF),

Audit-driven governance.

This forms the IAM baseline for a secure, scalable, and audit-ready GCP environment.
